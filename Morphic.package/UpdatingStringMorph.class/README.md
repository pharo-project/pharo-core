A StringMorph that constantly tries to show the current data from the target object.  When sent #step, it shows what the target objects has (target perform: getSelector).  When edited (with shift-click), it writes back to the target.

floatPrecision = 1. to round to integer.
floatPrecision = .1 to round to 1 decimal place, etc.

Even when ((target isNil) or: [getSelector == nil]), the user would still like to edit the string with shift-click.
