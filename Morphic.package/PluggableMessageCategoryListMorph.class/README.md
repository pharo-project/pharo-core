A variant of PluggableListMorph designed specially for efficient handling of the --all-- feature in message-list panes.  In order to be able *quickly* to check whether there has been an external change to the list, we cache the raw list for identity comparison (the actual list is a combination of the --all-- element and the the actual list).
