setNumArgs: numArgs toMethod: theMethod"All that line is to change the argument count of a CompiledMethod header. The argument count is 4 bits starting in the 24 and finishign in 27.16r787FFFFF is the hexa representation of a number that is all 1 and only those 4 bits in 0. Hence, when doing (theMethod header bitAnd: 16r787FFFFF) what we do is just to put zeros in those 4 bits.Now with the new argument size, we do bitShift: 24 and we obtain a 32 bits number with all zeros and just our 4 bits with the value we want.Since in the previous step we cleaned those 4 bits doing now a bitOr: with the second step, we have the result."	| xpc |		theMethod 		objectAt: 1 		put: (((theMethod header 			bitAnd: 2r01110000000000111111111111111111) 			bitOr: (numArgs bitShift: 24))			bitOr: (numArgs + 1 bitShift: 18)).		xpc := theMethod initialPC.	"long store temp"	(theMethod at: xpc) = 129 		ifTrue: [			theMethod at: xpc + 1 put: (16r40 + numArgs).			theMethod at: xpc + 3 put: (16r10 + numArgs)]
