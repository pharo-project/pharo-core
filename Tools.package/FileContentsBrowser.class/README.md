I am a class browser view on a fileout (either a source file (.st) or change set (.cs)). I do not actually load the code into to the system, nor do I alter the classes in the image. Use me to vet code in a comfortable way before loading it into your image.

From a FileList, I can be invoked by selecting a source file and selecting the "browse code" menu item from the yellow button menu.

I use PseudoClass, PseudoClassOrganizers, and PseudoMetaclass to model the class structure of the source file.
