i am used to detect recursion during code generation..use me like following:NBRecursionDetect in: someMethod during: [	... some block ..	].if recursion is detected, while evaluating the block, then NBCodeGenRecursion error will be signaled.A recursion usually happens when generating code for some method requires generating code for very same method, and so it enters infinite loop
