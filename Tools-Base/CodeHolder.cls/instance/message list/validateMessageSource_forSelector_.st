You mayproceed with caution but it is recommended that you get a new source file.This can happen if you download the "' , sourcesName  , '" file, or the ".changes" file you use, as TEXT. It must be transfered in BINARY mode, even if it looks like a text file, to preserve the CR line ends.Mac users: This may have been caused by Stuffit Expander. To prevent the files above to be converted to Mac line ends when they are expanded, do this: Start the program, then from Preferences... in the File menu, choose the Cross Platform panel, then select "Never" and press OK. Then expand the compressed archive again.(Occasionally, the source code for a method may legitimatelystart with a non-alphabetic character -- for example, Behaviormethod #formalHeaderPartsFor:.  In such rare cases, you canhappily disregard this warning.)'].
