I'm a generator of native code. I can create C style functions, providing convenient syntactic sugar for accessing the function arguments in function body (but you still have to write the body of the function with the assembler).I can be used for implementing small helper routines, low-level callbacks or functions which will run in separate (to VM) thread.A function spec is used to help with fetching arguments from call stack by using #arg: method for that: NBNativeFunctionGen 		cdecl: #( int (byte* a, byte * b) )		emit: [:gen | | asm |			asm := gen asm.			"this will load argument from stack to register"			asm mov: (gen arg: #b) to: EAX;		].By invoking the expression above, I will generate a native code and keep it in my instance. Now to put this code in use, it must be installed  (see #install) into external memory. Then an address to the function can be passed to any other external function,or even called by FFI callout:	myFunction := NBNativeFunctionGen cdecl: #(..) emit: [...].	myFunction install.	address := myFunction address.After function is no longer needed, it must be uninstalled (to conserve the external memory):	myFunction uninstall.Note, that this must be done explicitly, since like everything which works with external resources, there's no any automatic resource management for external memory.
