I am register used for the MMX integer instructions on IA-32 processors.MMX registers are 64Bit wide, depending on the instructions used the register is used either as 1 x 64bit value, 2 x 32bit values, 4 x 16bit values or 8 x 8bit values.Note that the MMX register overlap with the floating point register and only use the lower 64bits of the 80bits FPU registers.
