I am NonInteractiveTranscript, a replacement for Transcript, writing everything to a file or stdout.This is useful when running headless.	NonInteractiveTranscript file install.	To connect to the output stream of the virtual machine process choose stdout.	NonInteractiveTranscript stdout install.
