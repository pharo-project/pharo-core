See my #rationale.Several possibilities can occur. Here are some hints:- check whether some classes in the hierarchy just do not add enough behavior to require a class in itself- check whether all the classes are the root of a kind of little inheritance hierarchy. Note that often a framework may already define a certain level of inheritance, with  other layers added by user code. This rule does not take these frameworks into account. 		The defined inheritance depth can be edited in #inheritanceDepth.
