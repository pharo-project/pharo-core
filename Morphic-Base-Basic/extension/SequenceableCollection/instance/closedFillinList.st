closedFillinList	"Answers a list of ranges between which values are undertermined.	Reciever is a list that combines known values and nil entries for	undetermined values.	Answer a list of ranges. Each range starts and ends with a known	value. 	The range inbetween the known values are nil. The ranges start and	ends may overlap. 	Each nil element in the list appears in exactly one range. 	If the list starts or ends with nil the last range will wrap around to the	next known value. There may be only one known value in the list but	there must be atleast one know value.		(self allsatisfy: [ :e | e isNil ] ) ifTrue: [ self error: 'list must contain at	least one known value' ] 	"	| changes n |	changes := self nilTransitions .	changes isEmpty ifTrue: [ ^ { 0 to: self size } "Special case.
