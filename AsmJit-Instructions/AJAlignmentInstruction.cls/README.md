I am a pseudo instruction used to align the following instruction to a multiple of a given byte number.Example:	asm := AJx64Assembler noStackFrame.		"align the following instruction to a word (2bytes)"	asm alignWord.	asm inc: asm RAX.		"align the following instruction to a double (4bytes)"	asm alignDouble.	asm inc: asm RAX.		"align the following instruction to a QuadWord (8bytes)"	asm alignQuad.	asm inc: asm RAX.		"align the following instruction to a multiple of an arbirary count"	asm align: 64.	asm inc: asm RAX.
