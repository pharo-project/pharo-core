I am an abstract class that primarily serves for generating a machine code which converting arguments and return typesbetween Smalltalk and C worlds. My subclasses implementing a marshalling for concrete type, which is then used by FFI. Instance Variables:	pointerArity	<Integer>		loader	<NBVariableLoader>: an instance of argument loader, which emits code to load the smalltalk argument into register.			When generating the marshalling code to push a variable, my instances need this helper which, depending on where the object is (inst var, method arg, etc) gets the object in question into a register.
