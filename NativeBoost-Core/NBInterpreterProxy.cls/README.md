I am an important part of a native code generation toolchain, which provides an access to all interpreterProxy functions.A native code, inevitably, needs to convert a method's arguments to their native representations, and access a different fields of oops. For this, we need to use interpreter proxy methods.Code generator options, used by proxy: 	#optNonMovable		- The code is a standalone routine, which 		a) will be placed into a non-movable memory region.		b) can be called by any other function, not by primitiveNativeCall, therefore		#optDirectProxyFnAddress		- call proxy functions directly, instead of loading 		their address indirectly via interpreterProxy struct	 #optUseStackPointer 		- use a direct ST stack pointer, initially retrieved using #getStackPointer
