NonReentrantWeakMessageSend does what it says, while the message is being executed, additional evaluations will be discarded.It's used by when:sendOnce:to: protocol from Polymorph events, but unused in the base image.when:send:to:exclusive: is used one place though.It's useful when objects are mutually registered to each other's events, but the actions may lead to the others action being triggered.Examples are - two lists whose contents update based on the selection in the other- The DiffMorph (Uses ExclusiveWeakMessageSend)ExclusiveWeakMessageSend are used when the decision whether to process an event is shared between multiple objects.IE 2 objects respond to different events, but if received simultaneously, only the first of them should have it's action executed.With Announcement, the corresponding functionality to non-reentrancy would be achieved using:VW - AnnouncementCollection>>suspendWhile:  anActionBlockPharo - Announcer >> suspend: aSubscriber while: anActionBlock (As we neither have a specific AnnouncementCollection class, nor access to Registry itself. Not implemented yet though :P)The shared state required to achieve Exclusivity would probably have to recide outside of the framework.
