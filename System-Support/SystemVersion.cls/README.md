I am responsible for maintaining what version of Squeak and the VM is running.  I also track all of the update items that have been included in the image.I'm invoked at auto start to get the latest plugins, etc.Some queries are	SystemVersion current major	SystemVersion current minor	SystemVersion current suffix	SystemVersion current	highestUpdate
