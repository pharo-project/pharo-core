I am the main way that a process may pause for some amount of time.  The simplest usage is like this:	(Delay forSeconds: 5) wait.An instance of Delay responds to the message 'wait' by suspending the caller's process for a certain amount of time. The duration of the pause is specified when the Delay is created with the message forMilliseconds: or forSeconds:. A Delay can be used again when the current wait has finished. For example, a clock process might repeatedly wait on a one-second Delay.The maximum delay is (SmallInteger maxVal // 2) milliseconds, or about six days. A delay in progress when an image snapshot is saved is resumed when the snapshot is re-started. Delays work across millisecond clock roll-overs.For a more complex example, see  #testDelayOf:for:rect: .BTC-2014-10-26 This example is currently not in image. Where is it?DelayBenchmark provides a means for evaluating modifications.
