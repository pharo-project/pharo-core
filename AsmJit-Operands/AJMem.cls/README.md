I am memory operand used in assembly instructions. I can be created from an immedate or a register.Memory operands are used to read values indirectly from memory using certain offsets.Example:	asm := AJx86Assembler new.		"create an memory operand on the address 1234"	1234 asImm ptr		"create a simple memory operand with RAX as base"	asm RAX ptr.		"the same with a 8 byte offset"	asm RAX ptr + 8
