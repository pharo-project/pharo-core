I represent a point in UTC time as defined by ISO 8601. I have zero duration.My implementation uses three SmallIntegers and a Duration:jdn		- julian day number.seconds	- number of seconds since midnight.nanos	- the number of nanoseconds since the second.offset	- duration from UTC.The nanosecond attribute is almost always zero but it defined for full ISO compliance and is suitable for timestamping.
