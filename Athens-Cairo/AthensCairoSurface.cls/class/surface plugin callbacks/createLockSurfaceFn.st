createLockSurfaceFn	"	int lockSurface(int handle, int *pitch, int x, int y, int w, int h);		Lock the bits of the surface.		Return a pointer to the actual surface bits, or NULL on failure.		If successful, store the pitch of the surface (e.g., the bytes		per scan line).		For equal source/dest handles only one locking operation is performed.		This is to prevent locking of overlapping areas which does not work with		certain APIs (e.g., DirectDraw prevents locking of overlapping areas). 		A special case for non-overlapping but equal source/dest handle would 		be possible but we would have to transfer this information over to 		unlockSurfaces somehow (currently, only one unlock operation is 		performed for equal source and dest handles). Also, this would require		a change in the notion of ioLockSurface() which is right now interpreted		as a hint and not as a requirement to lock only the specific portion of		the surface.		The arguments in ioLockSurface() provide the implementation with		an explicit hint what area is affected. It can be very useful to		know the max. affected area beforehand if getting the bits requires expensive		copy operations (e.g., like a roundtrip to the X server or a glReadPixel op).		However, the returned pointer *MUST* point to the virtual origin of the surface		and not to the beginning of the rectangle. The promise made by BitBlt		is to never access data outside the given rectangle (aligned to 4byte boundaries!)		so it is okay to return a pointer to the virtual origin that is actually outside		the valid memory area.		The area provided in ioLockSurface() is already clipped (e.g., it will always		be inside the source and dest boundingBox) but it is not aligned to word boundaries		yet. It is up to the support code to compute accurate alignment if necessary.	"	| fn |	fn := NBNativeFunctionGen 		cdecl: #(int (int handle, int *pitch, int x, int y, int w, int h) )		emit: [:gen :proxy :asm | | callInfo fnPtr |			" the handle is a handle to cairo image surface (cairo_surface_t *) "			"*pitch = cairo_image_surface_get_stride ( handle )"			asm cdeclCall: [:call |				call push: (gen arg: #handle).				asm					mov: (self fnPtr: 'cairo_image_surface_get_stride') asUImm32 to: asm EAX;					call: asm EAX			] alignment: gen stackAlignment;						mov: (gen arg: #pitch) to: asm EDX;			mov: asm EAX to: asm EDX ptr.					" return cairo_image_surface_get_data ()"			asm cdeclCall: [:call |				call push: (gen arg: #handle).				asm					mov: (self fnPtr: 'cairo_image_surface_get_data') asUImm32 to: asm EAX;					call: asm EAX			] alignment: gen stackAlignment		].		fn install.	^ fn address
