movddup: aRegisterOrMemory1 with: aRegisterOrMemory2	"Move One Double-FP and Duplicate	Description-----------The linear address corresponds to the address of the least-significantbyte of the referenced memory data. When a memory address is indicated,the 8 bytes of data at memory location m64 are loaded. When theregister-register form of this operation is used, the lower half of the128-bit source register is duplicated and copied into the 128-bitdestination register.In 64-bit mode, use of the REX.R prefix permits this instruction toaccess additional registers (XMM8-XMM15)."	^ self 		addInstruction: #movddup		operands: { aRegisterOrMemory1 . aRegisterOrMemory2 }
