movss: aRegisterOrMemory1 with: aRegisterOrMemory2	"Move Scalar Single-FP Values	Description-----------Moves a scalar single-precision floating-point value from the sourceoperand (second operand) to the destination operand (first operand). Thesource and destination operands can be XMM registers or 32-bit memorylocations. This instruction can be used to move a single-precisionfloating-point value to and from the low doubleword of an XMM registerand a 32-bit memory location, or to move a single-precisionfloating-point value between the low doublewords of two XMM registers.The instruction cannot be used to transfer data between memorylocations.When the source and destination operands are XMM registers, the threehigh-order doublewords of the destination operand remain unchanged. Whenthe source operand is a memory location and destination operand is anXMM registers, the three high-order doublewords of the destinationoperand are cleared to all 0s.In 64-bit mode, use of the REX.R prefix permits this instruction toaccess additional registers (XMM8-XMM15)."	^ self 		addInstruction: #movss		operands: { aRegisterOrMemory1 . aRegisterOrMemory2 }
