div: aDestination	"Unsigned Divide	Description-----------Divides unsigned the value in the AX, DX:AX, EDX:EAX, or RDX:RAXregisters (dividend) by the source operand (divisor) and stores theresult in the AX (AH:AL), DX:AX, EDX:EAX, or RDX:RAX registers. Thesource operand can be a general-purpose register or a memory location.The action of this instruction depends on the operand size(dividend/divisor). Division using 64-bit operand is available only in64-bit mode.Non-integral results are truncated (chopped) towards 0. The remainder isalways less than the divisor in magnitude. Overflow is indicated withthe \#DE (divide error) exception rather than with the CF flag.In 64-bit mode, the instruction's default operation size is 32 bits. Useof the REX.R prefix permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Useof the REX.W prefix promotes operation to 64 bits. In 64-bit mode whenREX.W is applied, the instruction divides the unsigned value in RDX:RAXby the source operand and stores the quotient in RAX, the remainder inRDX.See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding dataand limits.
