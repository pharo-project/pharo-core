cmp: aRegisterOrMemoryOperand with: aSource	"Compare Two Operands	Pseudo Code-----------temp = SRC1 - SignExtend(SRC2);ModifyStatusFlags; (* Modify status flags in the same manner as the SUB instruction *)Description-----------Compares the first source operand with the second source operand andsets the status flags in the EFLAGS register according to the results.The comparison is performed by subtracting the second operand from thefirst operand and then setting the status flags in the same manner asthe SUB instruction. When an immediate value is used as an operand, itis sign-extended to the length of the first operand.The condition codes used by the Jcc, CMOVcc, and SETcc instructions arebased on the results of a CMP instruction. Appendix B, 'EFLAGS ConditionCodes,' in theIntel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer'sManual, Volume 1, shows the relationship of the status flags and thecondition codes.In 64-bit mode, the instruction's default operation size is 32 bits. Useof the REX.R prefix permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Useof the REX.W prefix promotes operation to 64 bits. See the summary chartat the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits."	^ self 		addInstruction: #cmp		operands: { aRegisterOrMemoryOperand . aSource }
