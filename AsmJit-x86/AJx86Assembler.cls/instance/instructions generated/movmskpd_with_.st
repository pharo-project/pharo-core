movmskpd: aRegisterOrMemory1 with: aRegisterOrMemory2	"Extract Packed Double-FP Sign Mask	Pseudo Code-----------DEST[0] = SRC[63];DEST[1] = SRC[127];IF DEST = r32    DEST[31:2] = ZeroExtend;ELSE    DEST[63:2] = ZeroExtend;FI;Description-----------Extracts the sign bits from the packed double-precision floating-pointvalues in the source operand (second operand), formats them into a 2-bitmask, and stores the mask in the destination operand (first operand).The source operand is an XMM register, and the destination operand is ageneral-purpose register. The mask is stored in the 2 low-order bits ofthe destination operand. Zero-extend the upper bits of the destination.In 64-bit mode, the instruction can access additional registers(XMM8-XMM15, R8-R15) when used with a REX.R prefix. The default operandsize is 64-bit in 64-bit mode."	^ self 		addInstruction: #movmskpd		operands: { aRegisterOrMemory1 . aRegisterOrMemory2 }
