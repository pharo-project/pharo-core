add: aRegisterOrMemoryOperand with: aSource	"Add	Pseudo Code-----------DEST = DEST + SRC;Description-----------Adds the destination operand (first operand) and the source operand(second operand) and then stores the result in the destination operand.The destination operand can be a register or a memory location; thesource operand can be an immediate, a register, or a memory location.(However, two memory operands cannot be used in one instruction.) Whenan immediate value is used as an operand, it is sign-extended to thelength of the destination operand format.The ADD instruction performs integer addition. It evaluates the resultfor both signed and unsigned integer operands and sets the OF and CFflags to indicate a carry (overflow) in the signed or unsigned result,respectively. The SF flag indicates the sign of the signed result.This instruction can be used with a LOCK prefix to allow the instructionto be executed atomically.In 64-bit mode, the instruction's default operation size is 32 bits.Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additionalregisters (R8-R15). Using a REX a REX prefix in the form of REX.Wpromotes operation to 64 bits. See the summary chart at the beginning ofthis section for encoding data and limits."	^ self 		addInstruction: #add		operands: { aRegisterOrMemoryOperand . aSource }
