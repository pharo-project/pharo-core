movaps: aRegisterOrMemory1 with: aRegisterOrMemory2	"Move Aligned Packed Single-FP Values	Pseudo Code-----------DEST = SRC;(* #GP if SRC or DEST unaligned memory operand *)Description-----------Moves a double quadword containing four packed single-precisionfloating-point values from the source operand (second operand) to thedestination operand (first operand). This instruction can be used toload an XMM register from a 128-bit memory location, to store thecontents of an XMM register into a 128-bit memory location, or to movedata between two XMM registers. When the source or destination operandis a memory operand, the operand must be aligned on a 16-byte boundaryor a general-protection exception (\#GP) is generated.To move packed single-precision floating-point values to or fromunaligned memory locations, use the MOVUPS instruction.In 64-bit mode, use of the REX.R prefix permits this instruction toaccess additional registers (XMM8-XMM15)."	^ self 		addInstruction: #movaps		operands: { aRegisterOrMemory1 . aRegisterOrMemory2 }
