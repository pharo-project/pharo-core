or: aRegisterOrMemoryOperand with: aSource	"Logical Inclusive OR	Pseudo Code-----------DEST = DEST OR SRC;Description-----------Performs a bitwise inclusive OR operation between the destination(first) and source (second) operands and stores the result in thedestination operand location. The source operand can be an immediate, aregister, or a memory location; the destination operand can be aregister or a memory location. (However, two memory operands cannot beused in one instruction.) Each bit of the result of the OR instructionis set to 0 if both corresponding bits of the first and second operandsare 0; otherwise, each bit is set to 1.This instruction can be used with a LOCK prefix to allow the instructionto be executed atomically.In 64-bit mode, the instruction's default operation size is 32 bits.Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additionalregisters (R8-R15). Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotesoperation to 64 bits. See the summary chart at the beginning of thissection for encoding data and limits."	^ self 		addInstruction: #or		operands: { aRegisterOrMemoryOperand . aSource }
