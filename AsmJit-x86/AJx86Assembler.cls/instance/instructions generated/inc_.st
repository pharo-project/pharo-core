inc: aRegisterOrMemory	"Increment by 1	Pseudo Code-----------DEST = DEST + 1;AFlags AffectedThe CF flag is not affected. The OF, SF, ZF, AF, and PF flags are set according to the result.Description-----------Adds 1 to the destination operand, while preserving the state of the CFflag. The destination operand can be a register or a memory location.This instruction allows a loop counter to be updated without disturbingthe CF flag. (Use a ADD instruction with an immediate operand of 1 toperform an increment operation that does updates the CF flag.)This instruction can be used with a LOCK prefix to allow the instructionto be executed atomically.In 64-bit mode, INC r16 and INC r32 are not encodable (because opcodes40H through 47H are REX prefixes). Otherwise, the instruction's 64-bitmode default operation size is 32 bits. Use of the REX.R prefix permitsaccess to additional registers (R8-R15). Use of the REX.W prefixpromotes operation to 64 bits."	^ self 		addInstruction: #inc		operands: { aRegisterOrMemory }
