fldenv: aMemoryOperand	"Load x87 FPU Environment	Pseudo Code-----------FPUControlWord = SRC[FPUControlWord];FPUStatusWord = SRC[FPUStatusWord];FPUTagWord = SRC[FPUTagWord];FPUDataPointer = SRC[FPUDataPointer];FPUInstructionPointer = SRC[FPUInstructionPointer];FPULastInstructionOpcode = SRC[FPULastInstructionOpcode];Description-----------Loads the complete x87 FPU operating environment from memory into theFPU registers. The source operand specifies the first byte of theoperating-environment data in memory. This data is typically written tothe specified memory location by a FSTENV or FNSTENV instruction.The FPU operating environment consists of the FPU control word, statusword, tag word, instruction pointer, data pointer, and last opcode.Figures 8-9 through 8-12 in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 ArchitecturesSoftware Developer's Manual, Volume 1, show the layout in memory of theloaded environment, depending on the operating mode of the processor(protected or real) and the current operand-size attribute (16-bit or32-bit). In virtual-8086 mode, the real mode layouts are used.The FLDENV instruction should be executed in the same operating mode asthe corresponding FSTENV/FNSTENV instruction.If one or more unmasked exception flags are set in the new FPU statusword, a floating-point exception will be generated upon execution of thenext floating-point instruction (except for the no-wait floating-pointinstructions, see the section titled 'Software Exception Handling' inChapter 8 of the Intel®64 and IA-32 ArchitecturesSoftware Developer'sManual, Volume 1). To avoid generating exceptions when loading a newenvironment, clear all the exception flags in the FPU status word thatis being loaded.If a page or limit fault occurs during the execution of thisinstruction, the state of the x87 FPU registers as seen by the faulthandler may be different than the state being loaded from memory. Insuch situations, the fault handler should ignore the status of the x87FPU registers, handle the fault, and return. The FLDENV instruction willthen complete the loading of the x87 FPU registers with no resultingcontext inconsistency.This instruction's operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bitmode."	^ self 		addInstruction: #fldenv		operands: { aMemoryOperand }
