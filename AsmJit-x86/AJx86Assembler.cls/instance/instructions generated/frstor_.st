frstor: aMemoryOperand	"Restore x87 FPU State	Description-----------Loads the FPU state (operating environment and register stack) from thememory area specified with the source operand. This state data istypically written to the specified memory location by a previousFSAVE/FNSAVE instruction.The FPU operating environment consists of the FPU control word, statusword, tag word, instruction pointer, data pointer, and last opcode.Figures 8-9 through 8-12 in the Intel® 64 and IA-32 ArchitecturesSoftware Developer's Manual, Volume 1, show the layout in memory of thestored environment, depending on the operating mode of the processor(protected or real) and the current operand-size attribute (16-bit or32-bit). In virtual-8086 mode, the real mode layouts are used. Thecontents of the FPU register stack are stored in the 80 bytesimmediately following the operating environment image.The FRSTOR instruction should be executed in the same operating mode asthe corresponding FSAVE/FNSAVE instruction.If one or more unmasked exception bits are set in the new FPU statusword, a floating-point exception will be generated. To avoid raisingexceptions when loading a new operating environment, clear all theexception flags in the FPU status word that is being loaded.This instruction's operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bitmode."	^ self 		addInstruction: #frstor		operands: { aMemoryOperand }
