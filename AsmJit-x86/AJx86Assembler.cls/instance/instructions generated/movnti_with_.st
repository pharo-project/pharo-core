movnti: aRegisterOrMemory1 with: aRegisterOrMemory2	"Store Doubleword Using Non-Temporal Hint	Pseudo Code-----------DEST = SRC;Description-----------Moves the doubleword integer in the source operand (second operand) tothe destination operand (first operand) using a non-temporal hint tominimize cache pollution during the write to memory. The source operandis a general-purpose register. The destination operand is a 32-bitmemory location.The non-temporal hint is implemented by using a write combining (WC)memory type protocol when writing the data to memory. Using thisprotocol, the processor does not write the data into the cachehierarchy, nor does it fetch the corresponding cache line from memoryinto the cache hierarchy. The memory type of the region being written tocan override the non-temporal hint, if the memory address specified forthe non-temporal store is in an uncacheable (UC) or write protected (WP)memory region. For more information on non-temporal stores, see 'Cachingof Temporal vs. Non-Temporal Data' in Chapter 10 in theIntel®64 andIA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 1.Because the WC protocol uses a weakly-ordered memory consistency model,a fencing operation implemented with the SFENCE or MFENCE instructionshould be used in conjunction with MOVNTI instructions if multipleprocessors might use different memory types to read/write thedestination memory locations.In 64-bit mode, the instruction's default operation size is 32 bits. Useof the REX.R prefix permits access to additional registers (R8-R15). Useof the REX.W prefix promotes operation to 64 bits. See the summary chartat the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits."	^ self 		addInstruction: #movnti		operands: { aRegisterOrMemory1 . aRegisterOrMemory2 }
