xchg: aDestinationRegisterOrMemory with: aSourceRegister	"Exchange Register/Memory with Register	Pseudo Code-----------TEMP = DEST;DEST = SRC;SRC = TEMP;Description-----------Exchanges the contents of the destination (first) and source (second)operands. The operands can be two general-purpose registers or aregister and a memory location. If a memory operand is referenced, theprocessor's locking protocol is automatically implemented for theduration of the exchange operation, regardless of the presence orabsence of the LOCK prefix or of the value of the IOPL. (See the LOCKprefix description in this chapter for more information on the lockingprotocol.)This instruction is useful for implementing semaphores or similar datastructures for process synchronization. (See 'Bus Locking' in Chapter 8of theIntel® 64 and IA-32Architectures Software Developer's Manual,Volume 3A, for more information on bus locking.)The XCHG instruction can also be used instead of the BSWAP instructionfor 16-bit operands.In 64-bit mode, the instruction's default operation size is 32 bits.Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.R permits access to additionalregisters (R8-R15). Using a REX prefix in the form of REX.W promotesoperation to 64 bits. See the summary chart at the beginning of thissection for encoding data and limits."	^ self 		addInstruction: #xchg		operands: { aDestinationRegisterOrMemory . aSourceRegister }
