mul: aDestination	"Unsigned Multiply	Description-----------Performs an unsigned multiplication of the first operand (destinationoperand) and the second operand (source operand) and stores the resultin the destination operand. The destination operand is an impliedoperand located in register AL, AX or EAX (depending on the size of theoperand); the source operand is located in a general-purpose register ora memory location. The action of this instruction and the location ofthe result depends on the opcode and the operand size as shown in thefollowing table.The result is stored in register AX, register pair DX:AX, or registerpair EDX:EAX (depending on the operand size), with the high-order bitsof the product contained in register AH, DX, or EDX, respectively. Ifthe high-order bits of the product are 0, the CF and OF flags arecleared; otherwise, the flags are set.In 64-bit mode, the instruction's default operation size is 32 bits. Useof the REX.R prefix permits access to additional registers (R8 - R15).Use of the REX.W prefix promotes operation to 64 bits.See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding dataand limits.  Operand Size   Source 1   Source 2   Destination  -------------- ---------- ---------- -------------  Byte           AL         r/m8       AX  Word           AX         r/m16      DX:AX  Doubleword     EAX        r/m32      EDX:EAX  Quadword       RAX        r/m64      RDX:RAX  : MUL Results"	^ self 		addInstruction: #mul		operands: { aDestination }
