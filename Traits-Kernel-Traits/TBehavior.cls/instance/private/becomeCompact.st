If a class was compact in a release of Pharo, no other class may use that index.  The class might not be compact later, and there should be nil in its place in the array."	| cct index |	self isWeak ifTrue: [^ Halt halt: 'You must not make a weak class compact'].	cct := Smalltalk compactClassesArray.	(self isCompact or: [cct includes: self])		ifTrue: [^ self halt: self name , 'is already compact'].	index := cct indexOf: nil		ifAbsent: [^ self halt: 'compact class table is full'].	"Install this class in the compact class table"	cct at: index put: self.	"Update instspec so future instances will be compact"	self setFormat: self format + (index bitShift: 11).	"Make up new instances and become old ones into them"	self updateInstancesFrom: self.	"Purge any old instances"	Smalltalk garbageCollect.
