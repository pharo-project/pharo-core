A ViewHierarchyExplorer is specialized Explorer that works exclusively with morphs.  It provides the user with a tree view of the Morph Composition Hierarchy and allows you to quickly identify a tree item with its corresponding morph by "flashing" the node in question.  This tool facilitates the understanding of complex morph compositions.A View Hierarchy Explorer can be opened from the Halo Debug Menu > "explore view hierarchy", or simply send #ExploreViewHierarchy to any morph instance.try..[World exploreViewHierarchy]and[OBPackageBrowser open exploreViewHierarchy]
